## Data structure and Algothrims

- Array
    - Array: is a single var that is used to store different elements
    - It is often used when we want to store a list of elements and access them by a single variable.
    - Advantages and Disavantages an Array:
        - Advantages: 
            - Arrays help in code optimization. We can store a large number of values in a single array by writing a small piece of code rather than declaring each variable separately.
            - The time complexity to access any element of an array is O(1), i.e, it takes a constant amount of time to access an element.
        - Disadvantages:
            - The size of an array is fixed. Once the memory is allocated to an array, it cannot be increased or decreased. This prevents us from storing extra data in case we want to
            - Not resizable - while the program is executing we cannot change the size of the array which leads to having to pre-allocate a large amount of memory before running the program causing waste.

- Linked List
    - Linked List: is a collection of nodes that are linked together. The following node contains the link to the previous node
